This project is a roguelike that can be run in the terminal. It is 1 wave of 1v1 monster fights, with 1 types of monster battle available. More features were planned but i ran out of time.
You are given base stats and a mech suit that adds to your stats. Your mech suit is what is going to be upgraded over time, and you can choose what kind of base stats you have at the beginning to suit your playstyle.

# How to compile:
Download the code, and extract it. Save it somewhere. Make sure the theGame.java stays where it is.
To compile it, just execute in the command prompt

`
cd [folder directory of APCSPROJECT], then
javac *.java
`
However, you should also pull the class files as well. But compile to be safe.

# How to run:
To run it, run
java theGame

after switching to the directory of MainGameNec.

If you have an IDE like VS code, just git clone the repository and run. It will auto compile and run the game. In the inputs other than putting in your name, only put in integer values.

Success! Accepted into APCS for the spring semester.
